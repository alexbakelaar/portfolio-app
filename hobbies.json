For the last five years I have been building custom PCs, focusing on showing off the internals with proper cable management on both the inside and outside. Keeping up to date on the latest hardware that comes to market is another enjoyment, as I plan builds a year in advance. Stay tuned to my custom loop build coming later this summer.
